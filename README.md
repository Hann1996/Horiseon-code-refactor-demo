# Horiseon-code-refactor-demo

## Description

This project is a code refactor for the Horiseon website homepage. This refactoring aims to make the previous code more efficient, understandable and accessible. This refactoring should also result in improved search engine optimization

For this challenge, I was tasked with refactoring the codebase for Horiseon, a fictional marketing agency.

Acceptance Criteria
Title element is concise and descriptive
Proper usage of semantic HTML elements
Logical structure of HTML elements independent of styling and positioning
Image elements contain accessible alt attributes
Heading attributes fall in sequential order
The client has requested a landing page that is optimized for search engines and follows accessibility standards.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

-
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
