# Horiseon-code-refactor-demo

## Description

This project is a code refactor for the Horiseon website homepage. This refactoring aims to make the previous code more efficient, understandable and accessible. This refactoring should also result in improved search engine optimization

## Acceptance Criteria

- Title element is concise and descriptive
- Proper usage of semantic HTML elements
- Logical structure of HTML elements independent of styling and positioning
- Image elements contain accessible alt attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- The client has requested a landing page that is optimized for search engines and follows accessibility standards.
